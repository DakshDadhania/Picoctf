that depends on your OS and browser (for me, it says Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0, but yours will likel be different).

That string of text is known as a User-Agent and it tells the server what browser you're using.

To convince them that you're running pico browser, you can just change your user-agent string. To do this, I chose to use curl because it easily allows you to control the headers. You need to run

curl --user-agent "picobrowser" "https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/32205/flag"
